Domain Name System (DNS) is an integral part of the internet. It converts IP addresses to human readable addresses such as tcm-sec.com or google.com.

There are several types of DNS servers used worldwide:
 * DNS root server
 * Authoritative name server
 * Non-authoritative name server
 * Caching server
 * Forwarding server
 * Resolver

| Server Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| DNS Root Server | Manages the top-level domains (TLDs) such as country-code TLDs. Overseen by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and NUmbers (ICANN) and is responsible for translating IP addresses to domain names. Ther are 13 world-wide. Only requested if the name server does not response. |
| Authoritative Nameserver | Hold authority for a particular zone and respond to queries only within their area of responsibility. The response is binding. If the authoritative nameserver cannot respond to a client's query, the root server takes over. |
| Non-Authoritative Nameserver | These servers collect information on specific DNS zones but are not responsible for any DNS in particular. |
| Caching DNS Server | Cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The duration of the storage is determined by the authoritative name server. |
| Forwarding Server | The only function these servers have is forwarding DNS queries to other DNS servers. |
| Resolver | Perform name resolution locally in the computer or router. |


| DNS Record Type | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| A | Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain. |
| AAAA | Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain. |
| MX | Returns the mail servers. |
| NS | Returns the DNS nameservers of the domain. |
| TXT | A general purpose record used to validate Google search console or SSL certificates for example. [Sender Policy Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4408) and [Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)](https://dmarc.org/) entries are used to validate mail traffic and protect it from spam. |
| CNAME | Acts as an alias for another domain. If you want www.example-domain.com to point to the same IP as another domain, you would create an A record for the other domain and a CNAME record for www.example-domain.com. |
| PTR | Converts IP addresses into valid domain names. |
| SOA | Provides information on the corresponding DNS zone and email addresses of the adminsitrators. |
