# Authentication

Authentication is the process of proving one's identity. This is done by verifying the identity of a person or device.[^1]

# Multifactor Authentication

Multifactor authentication (MFA or 2FA) involves providing an additional factor to authenticate an account, often used to protect against brute force attacks.[^2]

# Authorization

Authorization grants an authenticated party permission to perform certain actions. It specifies what data can be accessed and what can be done with that data.[^3]

# Causes of Authentication Vulnerabilities

Most authentication vulnerabilities arise in two ways:
- Weak authentication mechanisms fail to protect against brute-force attacks.
- Logic flaws or poor coding allow authentication mechanisms to be bypassed, known as "broken authentication".[^4]

# Mitigating Authentication Vulnerabilities

- Redirect HTTP login requests to HTTPS.
- Do not reflect credentials in HTTP requests.
- Use generic error messages to avoid username enumeration.
- Return the same HTTP status code for both successful and failed login attempts.
- Ensure response times are uniform to prevent enumeration via timing.
- Implement strict user rate limits, including IP-based rules to counter IP spoofing.
- Implement CAPTCHA after rate limits are exceeded or for suspicious login attempts.
- Enforce a strong password policy with real-time password strength estimations, e.g., [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn).
- Prevent users from using similar passwords (e.g., Password1 to Password2).
- Disallow use of account details (e.g., name, last name) in passwords.
- Harden password reset and change mechanisms.
- Implement multifactor authentication.
- Audit the website to ensure no credentials are publicly accessible.
- Audit the verification and multifactor authentication logic.
- Restrict public access to user profiles unless absolutely necessary.

# Impact

A malicious third party may bypass authentication or brute-force an account, including admin accounts, gaining access to account data. Compromising a low-level account can facilitate privilege escalation. Taking over an administrative account can lead to application-level compromise and further infiltration into internal networks.

# Summary

Authentication verifies the identity of the user or device, while authorization determines what actions the user or device is allowed to perform.
