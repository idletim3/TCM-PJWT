# Lab 01

Username: jeremy

Wordlist: xato-net-10-million-passwords-1000.txt

# Method 1: Burpsuite

- Intercept a login request and send it to intruder.
- Set password as the attack variable
- Use runtime file for larger password lists
- Start attack
- Inspect the results

# Method 2: Ffuf

- Save the intercepted request
- Edit the request to include "FUZZ" for the variable we wish to fuzz for
- Filter out false positives

```bash
ffuf -request [intercepted request file] -request-proto [http/https] -w [wordlist] [filters] -v -c
i.e.
ffuf -request lab01-login.req -request-proto http -w 500-worst-passwords.txt:FUZZ -fs 1814 -v -c
```



# Lab 02

Target account: jeremy

Your credentials: jessamy:pasta

The application keeps the user in a "purgatory" before MFA code is entered. However, it does not validate whether the MFA code generated was for the same account used in the username:password screen.
