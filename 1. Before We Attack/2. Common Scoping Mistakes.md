Takeways:
- Widening your skill set means there's more bugs you can cover.
- Automation should be the means to discovering a bug, not the end goal.
- Review the impact of discovered bugs
- Understanding the tested environment

###  Example:

[Program:](https://app.intigriti.com/researcher/programs/allegro/allegrobugbounty/detail)
> In this program you can only test our staging environment on .allegro.pl.allegrosandbox.pl and .allegro.cz.allegrosandbox.pl [...] Do not test our production environments on *.allegro.pl, *.allegro.cz or *.allegrogroup.com.

Testing *.allergro.pl/cz would directly violate the rules of engagemenet.

Understanding program rules is crucial to succeed as a bug bounty hunter. As previously mentioned, if doubt - ask.
