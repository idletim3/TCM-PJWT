# Scope

The scope sets legal and ethical boundaries for a penetration test or bug bounty program. Companies allocate varying resources to their applications. Practical considerations include system sensitivity and patching known vulnerabilities.

### Example 1:

In-scope: *.example.com
Out of scope: subdomain.example.com

### Example 2:

In-scope: *.subdomain.example.com, any subdomain i.e. A.B.C.subdomain.example.com is also included.

Out of scope: example.com

Bug bounty programs often follow "One fix, one reward" rule. Vulnerabiltiies requiring multiple fixes are not considered duplicates.

Important considerations:
- Disclosure terms 
- Collaboration
- Asking for updates
- Out of Scope (OOS) submissions
- Use of illegal or cracked software

Unethical practices include:
- Intentional duplicate reporting. 
- Hoarding vulnerabilities.
- Data exposure and accessing personal information, including sharing it with third parties
- Intrusive testing
- Pivoting
